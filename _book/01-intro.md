## Meet your Instructor

Hello, Welcome! all the students!

this is Tommy, your instructor for this course. Congratulations on signing up for this course. I am sure you will learn a lot. I created the first draft of this course during the holidays and with the help of ChatGPT, I was able to polish it quite a bit. This is not a perfect course, your feedback is greatly appreciated!

A little bit more about me. With over a decade of experience in computational biology, I specialize in genomics, epigenomics, and (single-cell) transcriptomics data analysis. I have taken on pivotal roles in various cancer research projects, notably contributing to the NCI's Cancer Moonshot initiative at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.

I am now the Director of Computational Biology at Immunitas Therapeutics, we employ machine-learning techniques to investigate immune cells in human tumors by analyzing single-cell RNAseq, single-cell TCRseq, and spatial transcriptome data. Our goal is to develop novel therapeutics for cancer patients. 

I am a self-trained computational biologist. I fully understand how challenging it is to learn computational biology from scratch. That's why beyond my professional work, I am passionate about promoting open science and improving bioinformatics education to equip biologists with computational skills.  More about me can be found at my website https://divingintogeneticsandgenomics.com/.

Enjoy this course! Let's go!

## The role of programming in Biology

In this lesson, we will discover how programming languages empower biologists to unravel the mysteries of life, make critical discoveries, and automate complex tasks. While we won't be diving into intricate technicalities, we'll explore the fundamental concepts that will serve as the foundation for your exploration into the world of computational biology and bioinformatics.

### What are programming languages?

Programming languages are a set of rules and instructions used by humans to communicate with computers. They serve as a bridge between human thought and machine execution, allowing us to convey complex tasks and algorithms to computers in a way they can understand and execute.

* Communication Tool: Programming languages are a means of communication between humans and computers. They provide a structured and understandable way for programmers to convey their intentions to the computer.

* Instructions: In a programming language, you write instructions or commands that specify what the computer should do. These instructions can range from simple tasks like adding numbers to complex processes like data analysis or simulation.

* Syntax: Programming languages have their syntax or grammar rules that programmers must follow. Syntax defines how instructions should be structured, including the order of words, punctuation, and formatting. Following the correct syntax is crucial for the computer to interpret the code correctly.

* Abstraction: Programming languages provide a level of abstraction. They allow us to work at a higher level of understanding, dealing with concepts like variables, functions, and data structures, without needing to worry about the low-level details of how the computer processes these instructions.

* Interpreter or Compiler: To execute code written in a programming language, you need either an interpreter or a compiler. An interpreter reads and executes code line by line, while a compiler translates the entire code into machine code before execution.

### Why programming is important in biology?

Ever wondered why programming is such a big deal in biology? It's because it gives biologists the superpower to handle mountains of data, uncover hidden patterns, and automate those repetitive lab tasks. Read this paper: All Biology is computational Biology. So, what makes programming tick in the world of biology? Let's delve deeper:

* Efficient Data Handling: In biology, we deal with enormous volumes of data, from DNA sequences to ecological observations. Programming allows us to efficiently manage and process this data. By automating data collection and analysis, we save time and minimize errors, ensuring that our research is based on accurate and comprehensive information.

* Complex Analysis: Biological research often involves intricate analyses, such as genetic sequence comparisons, statistical modeling, and simulations. Programming languages provide the tools to perform these complex tasks with precision and speed. These analyses can unveil hidden patterns, relationships, and insights that would be challenging or impossible to discover manually.

* Reproducibility: Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific research. Programming ensures that experiments and analyses can be replicated precisely. By sharing code, scientists can validate each other's findings and build upon existing research, fostering collaboration and advancing the field collectively.

* Automation: Many biological experiments and processes are repetitive. Programming enables the automation of these tasks, freeing researchers from mundane and time-consuming work. This automation not only improves efficiency but also reduces the risk of human error.

* Visualization: Visualization is a crucial aspect of biology, allowing researchers to represent complex data in understandable ways. Programming languages provide libraries and tools to create stunning visualizations, aiding in the interpretation and communication of research findings.

### What are the most used programming languages within biology?

#### Python: The Swiss Army Knife of Biology

Python is the go-to programming language in the field of biology, and for good reasons. It's known for its simplicity and readability, making it an ideal choice for biologists who may not have extensive programming backgrounds. Python offers a vast ecosystem of libraries and tools tailored for bioinformatics, data analysis, and scientific computing.

* Bioinformatics: Python excels in bioinformatics, with libraries like Biopython, which provides tools for sequence analysis, structural biology, and more. Biologists use Python to parse and manipulate DNA, RNA, and protein sequences effortlessly.

* Data Analysis: Python's libraries, such as NumPy, pandas, and matplotlib, make data analysis and visualization a breeze. Researchers can explore and visualize complex biological data, from gene expression profiles to ecological datasets.

* Machine Learning: Python's machine learning libraries like scikit-learn enable biologists to build predictive models for disease classification, drug discovery, and more. It's a valuable tool for harnessing the power of data.

#### R: The Statistical Powerhouse

R is another programming language highly favored by biologists, particularly for statistical analysis and data visualization. It's renowned for its statistical packages and robust graphing capabilities, making it an indispensable tool for researchers dealing with biological data.

* Statistical Analysis: R boasts an extensive collection of statistical packages and libraries, including Bioconductor, designed specifically for biological data analysis. Biologists rely on R for hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and experimental design.

* Data Visualization: With libraries like ggplot2, R allows biologists to create intricate and publication-quality visualizations. It's instrumental in presenting research findings effectively.

#### Julia: The Rising Star

Julia is an emerging programming language that has garnered attention in the scientific community, including biology. It's prized for its exceptional performance and versatility, making it suitable for computationally intensive tasks in genomics, proteomics, and more.

* Performance: Julia's speed rivals low-level languages like C and Fortran, making it a compelling choice for high-performance computing in biology. It's used for tasks like simulating biological systems and analyzing large datasets.

* Ease of Use: Julia's syntax is intuitive and easy to learn, appealing to both programmers and scientists. Its interactive environment fosters quick experimentation.

#### Other Programming Languages:

While Python, R, and Julia are the prominent choices, other programming languages find their niche in specific areas of biology:

* Perl: Historically used in bioinformatics for tasks like text processing and sequence analysis.

* Java: Commonly employed in developing bioinformatics software and applications.

* C/C++: Reserved for computationally intensive tasks where speed is critical, such as molecular dynamics simulations.
